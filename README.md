# IOS-project
    What is : An IOS game based on Spritekit, I am not use SpriteBuilder because it is not easy to download
              this software from web or Appstore.
              
    What I have done : The whole project is done by myself, because my groupmate seems not willing to finish 
              the job with me when this semester is over. So the game is different from what I report on the
              class. The story is about you control a planet to eat stars and dodge fireballs, very very simple
              which you can find in "How to play" part of beginning Scene. I add English-comments in every 
              swift files for further studying. Also, I provide 2 characters to choose, background pictures and 
              even background music. Sounds like click or boom is also existed. Those .mp3, .wav, .png materials
              in project are download from the web, then I use PS(online version) to adjust them carefully. 
              
    Some defeats : I just run the game on simulator, mainly on iphone 6s plus. And the author is remained as
              Apple, because I think there is no need to change authorID. This is a simple project, just for
              learning ios.
